## Excercise: 2016 election result and polling

### Question 1. What is the relationship between the population size and the number of electoral votes each state has?

**1a.** Use a `join` function to combine the `murders` dataset, which contains information on population size, and the`results_us_election_2016` dataset, which contains information on the number of electoral votes. Name this new dataset `q_1a`, and show its first 6 rows.

```{r}
